# Workflow

## GitHub

- [GitHub](www.github.com) is a popular collaboration and version control host for coding and software development, there are a lot of resources online about GitHub, e.g. [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/).
- GitHub workflow can get intricate in mature production software environments, again I'm not a software developer, but there are several very important tools that GitHub facilitates well:
  - Pull requests to support peer review of proposed changes to code
  - Diff identification and highlighting, reviewers, commenting... to support peer review
  - History tracking and reversion capabilities
  - Distributed contribution
  - Issue creation
  - Transparency and discoverability
- For basic GitHub workflows, see:
