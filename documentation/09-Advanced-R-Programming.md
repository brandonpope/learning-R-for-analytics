*Advanced* is certainly a relative term - here I mean advanced relative to basic concepts that I've found valuable in my work.

- [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) is an amazing package to applying functions/computations/... across sets and loops and things like that

## Advanced Tidyverse with `rlang` and non-standard eval

- passing variable names to functions - a.k.a. [tunneling data-variables](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/02/glue-strings-and-tidy-eval/)

## Miscellaneous and Other Resources
