# Coding

This page is about coding and a bit about software engineering. Code is how we express our analysis ideas to the computer, and just like writing, there is good coding and bad coding. Most people don't get great training (if any) on software engineering or coding, so it's usually an area where analysts can improve their craft quickly for a little effort.
