- API's
- [SQL Server Database connections in R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/sql-server-database-connections-in-r/)

- arguably the biggest reason the `tidyverse` set of packages exists is to created better solutions for getting data in, out, and especially wrangled in R
- Ted Laderas wrote a [nice blog post](https://hugo-portfolio-example.netlify.app/projects/tidyverse_functions/) about some of the underrated tidyverse functions
