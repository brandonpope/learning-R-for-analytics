# learningR For Analytics
I created this repository for myself and others as a meta-resource to using R for analytics. The primary value for me comes from the organized documentation and interoperability across systems - I formerly had most of this information and links in various bookmark folders on multiple machines and in some onboarding materials I had developed at work.

## Design Decisions

I considered using the `README.md` of the root repo, the GitHub Wiki feature, or a folder of documention with a `README.md` itself along with a set of .md files. I choose the latter of the three options because:
1. I wanted more practices with the Issue/Pull request workflow
2. The root repo `README.md` is most commonly a shorter description of the software/code in the repo (from what I've seen and what I read - I'm not a software developer myself).

In the process of researching to make this decision, I found Mike Bostock's excellent [D3 GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki), and [this list of Awesome README](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) examples and ideas.

## Scope

Data, Data Science, R, Statistics, Analytics, Computing... all of these topics are potentially extensive. My academic background started in mathematics and statistics, then engineering and economics. My industry experience has been all in healthcare, at the staff, manager, and executive levels. I would describe the scope of this book at the references and best practices I've found most useful for myself and my team in getting the job of analytics done. I think of the material covered as being broad, but not terribly deep in any topic.
