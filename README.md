# learningR
This repository is being created as a guided meta-resource to using R for analytics. The primary value for me comes from the organized documentation.

I considered using the README.md of the root repo, the GitHub Wiki feature, or a folder of documention with a README.md itself along with a set of .md files. I choose the latter of the three options because:
1. I wanted more practices with the Issue/Pull request workflow
2. The root repo README.md is most commonly a shorter description of the software/code in the repo
